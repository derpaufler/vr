:: TODO: allow users to specify what kind of headset, right now this script only supports WMR
:: TODO: users may want to disable certain features, not everyone might want the port disabled/enabled
:: TODO: figure out how to tuck this bat file in a "source" folder so that users only see the vbs and config file
:: TODO: minimize WMR immediately 
:: TODO: Tetracyclic should make it so that lighthouse-keeper has its own config file that it automatically populates with the MAC addresses; it automatically runs "discover" on first run, and populates this, so the user doesn't have to do this setup
:: TODO: Tetracyclic, in addition to above, should detect what version of lighthouses they have
:: TODO: submit our files to Microsoft for approval: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission
:: TODO: make a note in the readme that sometimes steam decides to create multiple chaperone universes, it's best to delete all but one and save that one
:: Note: when debugging syntax errors, comment the line at the top of the file
